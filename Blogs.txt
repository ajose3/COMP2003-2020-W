Week 1 (19/10/2020 â€“ 23/10/2020):

In the first week, the group met together and decided what role each member should occupy. 
In this meeting, the group took part in a Belbin team roles test and discussed our previous experiences. 
The results obtained illustrate that the group has a mixture of personalities. 
Additionally, by categorizing Belbin team roles into the three leadership roles, it gave the group a better understanding of the obligations about each member. 
Each of the leadership roles includes one Belbin role that has not been assigned as there are only six of us; therefore, we decided both members in each leadership role will share the unassigned obligations. 
This first meeting has shown what strengths and weaknesses each member of the group holds and how their chosen role will support success to the project.
