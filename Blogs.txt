Week 1 (19/10/2020 – 23/10/2020):

In the first week, the group met together and decided what role each member should occupy. 
In this meeting, the group took part in a Belbin team roles test and discussed our previous experiences. 
The results obtained illustrate that the group has a mixture of personalities. 
Additionally, by categorizing Belbin team roles into the three leadership roles, it gave the group a better understanding of the obligations about each member. 
Each of the leadership roles includes one Belbin role that has not been assigned as there are only six of us; therefore, we decided both members in each leadership role will share the unassigned obligations. 
This first meeting has shown what strengths and weaknesses each member of the group holds and how their chosen role will support success to the project.

Week 2 (26/10/2020-30/10/2020):

In the second week, the group met up to decide on our project scenarios and create a project brief. In the meeting we each took turns pitching our project ideas, we had come up with prior, to the rest of the group. Each member came up with at least one project we could do based on the project ideas for each course, provided on the DLE.
We decided to choose the computer science project as a few team members already have a base knowledge of web design and mobile app development which they have studied in their own time. This also worked out well because the majority of the team are studying computer science.
We decided to produce our recommendation system for an online electrical retailer. We plan for it to recommend products to customers based on a combination of their previous purchases and other products they have viewed. 
At the end of this meeting we feel like we have a strong idea of what our project involves and what we need to do next to progress in the module.

Week 3 (02/11/2020 – 05/11/2020):

In the third week the group meeting consisted of a few various things. 
Unfortunately, one of our members had to self-isolate for the current and next week meaning he could not attend in person. 
We first established a rota for who is responsible in writing the weeks blog. 
We then went on to discuss what time worked for all team members for this weeks’ stand up meeting with Shirley. 
Finally, we then started splitting the project up into five different categories database, write up, API, diagrams, interface. 
We had a discussion on what features were needed from the software we were creating as well as the entity and fields required for our database.
These were then made into tables and an ERD diagram for our database was drawn up. 
Assignments were then made on who should be making the other diagrams needed for the planning of our software framework such as a state diagrams, use case stories etc. 
These were assigned using the planner on teams and will be due for the next meeting. 
Lastly, we made a note of areas of clarification that had sprung up during our discussions in making the ERD and what features were needed from the software which we plan on raising with Shirley during our meeting.

Week 4 (09/11/20 – 13/11/20):

During week four, the group reflected on the diagrams we had made in the previous weeks and decided how to move forward with the project.
We looked closer at smaller technicalities and planning decisions that would impact how we proceed with our development, such as: our choice of development IDE, the database management system we will use and properly understanding and utilising version control in a group environment.
To achieve this, our goals for the week were to find information and resources to aid our choice in what IDE and database management system we would use – such as past and upcoming lectures – as well as other sources we found ourselves. 
As well as this, we all set out to properly understand and utilize GitHub version control through practise.

Week 5 (16/11/2020 - 20/11/2020):

In the fifth week, the group decided on a number of tasks that needed to be completed before development on the database could commence.
Due to the difficulties associated with meeting in person presented by the second Coronavirus lockdown in England, this was the first group meeting held entirely on Zoom.
Each member took turns discussing which tasks they believed to be most pressing regarding the desire to start development on the database the following week; enabling us to identify areas of particular concern.
Following further discussion, we narrowed down the concerns to three areas that required further research: risk assessment, login system implementation, and the required database stored procedures and triggers.
We decided that each task will be allocated to two members to jointly research, with each member volunteering for the task they wished to undertake; giving each member a task to complete for the following week.

Having reflected on it in the previous week, the group started by discussing our choice of development IDE and database management system for the project.
Given our previous experience, we all agreed it would be best to use C# and Visual Studio for the application's development, Microsoft SQL Server for database management, and JetBrains WebStorm for the development of the website.

Week 6 (23/11/2020 - 27/11/2020):

In week 6 we were once again meeting on zoom.
As a group we went over everything we did in the week before, ironing out any questions about the login system, triggers and procedures. then we looked at what should be achieved for the next week and collectively decided to focus on starting a basic GUI and getting the database set up. 
We split the GUI task into an admin GUI and a user GUI. 
Two members were assigned to each of the GUI’s and the database. We also discussed what would be necessary features for the GUI, like a basket system and payment options.

Week 7 (30/11/2020 – 4/12/2020):

In the seventh week, half the group met up in person and there was a zoom meeting at the same time with the other half. 
The tasks that were completed last week were uploaded to Teams for this week for everyone to review and we peer assessed each other’s work to see if everyone agreed with it. 
A few changes were made to the entity relationship diagram and the tables created because these changes were required after evaluating the wireframes built from the previous week. 
Also, the group identified what views, stored procedures and triggers were essential to the database. 
This was delegated between four members of the group to complete for next week. 
The other two members were assigned to start developing the admin interface so that it displays the databases.    

Week 8 (7/12/2020-11/12/2020):

In the eighth week, half the group met in person and the other half joined online.  
We reviewed each other’s tasks from last week and discussed issues we came across. 
When looking over the tables we noticed some fields were missing, we determined this was because we forgot to update our normalisation with the new fields we found in previous weeks. 
Two team members were assigned to adjust and test all the trigger, stored procedures, and views with the added columns in the database. 
It took longer than expected to create the basic admin interface, so we extended an extra week and assigned this to a single person this time as there is less to complete than the previous week. 
We then discussed the interim report, we decided that we are now able to start drafting the introduction and background sections of it, we split these between two team members. 
As it is approaching Christmas, we also decided that it was time to start making the basic app interface. 
We assigned this to a single team member to set up the initial app structure and setup a connection to the database. 

Week 9 (14/12/2020-18/12/2020):
This was the first week where all of us attended the meeting virtually.
All assignments from the previous week had been completed except for one.
The problem arising with the API as it was working and then stopped working after an update of the software. 
The admin interface had been uploaded to the second branch on Github. 
The SQL database had been fixed and a few extra stored procedures had also been added. 
The SQL script was then implemented into our Azure database. 
We decided on also uploading our SQL script to Github as well as plain text file. 
The Background and Introduction section in the report were written and inserted into the draft report.
Due to the problems with the API, we assigned an extra member to the task to complete it by the end of this week. 
A member was assigned the task of linking the mobile interface to ASP.NET and running tests on stored procedures locally. 
Another member is tasked with finding a way to generate data to populate the database with.  
The final two members were tasked with writing two other parts of our report those being project management and development approach.

Week 10 (11/01/21 – 15/11/21):

During week ten, the group looked back at what we had progressed on during week nine, as well as any work that may have been completed over the holiday period. 
This would be the last full week of work we would have before the deadlines coming in the following week, so during week ten we looked at what we had left to complete for our interim deliverables.
We decided our main priority would be mostly complete all remaining report sections, par the conclusion, as well as going over sections that had already been completed in order to ensure that all sections included all required information as well as the quality of work was up to a standard we were all happy with. Similarly, we decided to allocate some time to finishing some final touches on our application demo, as to allow us to showcase enough of it during the coming presentation.
Finally, we would take a bit of time to prepare for the marketplace demo in the following week, looking at how and what we would present. We divided up sections for a PowerPoint we had chosen to present between us to create and present on the day.

Week 11 (18/01/20201 - 22/01/2021):

This week our interim report was due, as well as our project presentation, resulting in a very busy week for our group.
As a group, we have met every day of the week up to the report deadline to ensure we met the deadlines to the best of our ability.
Having worked the previous week on them, we met on Monday to combine our presentation slides, and to review and finalise the presentation.
We performed multiple trial runs of the presentation, timing each section to ensure that we met the allotted presentation time.
As well as this, we decided on approaches to handle the remaining tasks for the upcoming deadlines, and delegated them accordingly.
The following day we presented our project and networked with other students on the course; we learnt a lot from experience, documenting the key observations in a video recording later that day.
On Wednesday the team met again review the report, delegate the final tasks and collaborate on improvements before submission.
Having completed the remaining tasks, we met again on the due date of the report for a final review of the report, including the completed tasks, and made any necessary changes, before submitting it.
In review of the weeks interactions, and in consideration of the end of the semester, we decided it would be beneficial to enact a week long interlude before proceeding again with the project.

Week 12 + 13 (23/01/2021 - 12/02/2021)

Last week we decided to not have a team meeting as we all had coursework. This week we reflected on the feedback given to us during our demo and decided that we needed to simply and find something unique in our system. We talked about how to do this and had some ideas to change our system to fetch data from other sites and use this to recommend instead of having our own ecommerce with products. 
We decided to ask Shirly before starting this just to make sure we were on the right track. Shirly informed us that our original product vision was a better route for us to take so we got started back on that. We outlined everything we needed to get done before the addition of the AI. We needed a functioning login system which would allow admins and users to log into our system with secure passwords. We need to collect realistic data for our database so we have decided to use a web scrapper to collect this as it would be the most efficient solution. We want to start on out rating system, allowing users to leave a rating on an item as this is going to be key data for the recommender system. connecting out database to our mobile app is something else we need to implement once we have some data so that we can test our recommender. 
We split these tasks up between us and decided that we all needed to know how to use Xamarin. Two of us know how the use it already so we gave two others the task to learn this week then the last two next week.
