Week 1 (19/10/2020 – 23/10/2020):

In the first week, the group met together and decided what role each member should occupy. 
In this meeting, the group took part in a Belbin team roles test and discussed our previous experiences. 
The results obtained illustrate that the group has a mixture of personalities. 
Additionally, by categorizing Belbin team roles into the three leadership roles, it gave the group a better understanding of the obligations about each member. 
Each of the leadership roles includes one Belbin role that has not been assigned as there are only six of us; therefore, we decided both members in each leadership role will share the unassigned obligations. 
This first meeting has shown what strengths and weaknesses each member of the group holds and how their chosen role will support success to the project.

Week 2 (26/10/2020-30/10/2020):

In the second week, the group met up to decide on our project scenarios and create a project brief. In the meeting we each took turns pitching our project ideas, we had come up with prior, to the rest of the group. Each member came up with at least one project we could do based on the project ideas for each course, provided on the DLE.
We decided to choose the computer science project as a few team members already have a base knowledge of web design and mobile app development which they have studied in their own time. This also worked out well because the majority of the team are studying computer science.
We decided to produce our recommendation system for an online electrical retailer. We plan for it to recommend products to customers based on a combination of their previous purchases and other products they have viewed. 
At the end of this meeting we feel like we have a strong idea of what our project involves and what we need to do next to progress in the module.

Week 3 (02/11/2020 – 05/11/2020):

In the third week the group meeting consisted of a few various things. 
Unfortunately, one of our members had to self-isolate for the current and next week meaning he could not attend in person. 
We first established a rota for who is responsible in writing the weeks blog. 
We then went on to discuss what time worked for all team members for this weeks’ stand up meeting with Shirley. 
Finally, we then started splitting the project up into five different categories database, write up, API, diagrams, interface. 
We had a discussion on what features were needed from the software we were creating as well as the entity and fields required for our database.
These were then made into tables and an ERD diagram for our database was drawn up. 
Assignments were then made on who should be making the other diagrams needed for the planning of our software framework such as a state diagrams, use case stories etc. 
These were assigned using the planner on teams and will be due for the next meeting. 
Lastly, we made a note of areas of clarification that had sprung up during our discussions in making the ERD and what features were needed from the software which we plan on raising with Shirley during our meeting.

Week 4 (09/11/20 – 13/11/20):

During week four, the group reflected on the diagrams we had made in the previous weeks and decided how to move forward with the project.
We looked closer at smaller technicalities and planning decisions that would impact how we proceed with our development, such as: our choice of development IDE, the database management system we will use and properly understanding and utilising version control in a group environment.
To achieve this, our goals for the week were to find information and resources to aid our choice in what IDE and database management system we would use – such as past and upcoming lectures – as well as other sources we found ourselves. 
As well as this, we all set out to properly understand and utilize GitHub version control through practise.

Week 5 (16/11/2020 - 20/11/2020):

In the fifth week, the group decided on a number of tasks that needed to be completed before development on the database could commence.
Due to the difficulties associated with meeting in person presented by the second Coronavirus lockdown in England, this was the first group meeting held entirely on Zoom.
Each member took turns discussing which tasks they believed to be most pressing regarding the desire to start development on the database the following week; enabling us to identify areas of particular concern.
Following further discussion, we narrowed down the concerns to three areas that required further research: risk assessment, login system implementation, and the required database stored procedures and triggers.
We decided that each task will be allocated to two members to jointly research, with each member volunteering for the task they wished to undertake; giving each member a task to complete for the following week.

Having reflected on it in the previous week, the group started by discussing our choice of development IDE and database management system for the project.
Given our previous experience, we all agreed it would be best to use C# and Visual Studio for the application's development, Microsoft SQL Server for database management, and JetBrains WebStorm for the development of the website.

Week 6 (23/11/2020 - 27/11/2020):

In week 6 we were once again meeting on zoom.
As a group we went over everything we did in the week before, ironing out any questions about the login system, triggers and procedures. then we looked at what should be achieved for the next week and collectively decided to focus on starting a basic GUI and getting the database set up. 
We split the GUI task into an admin GUI and a user GUI. 
Two members were assigned to each of the GUI’s and the database. We also discussed what would be necessary features for the GUI, like a basket system and payment options.

Week 7 (30/11/2020 – 4/12/2020):

In the seventh week, half the group met up in person and there was a zoom meeting at the same time with the other half. 
The tasks that were completed last week were uploaded to Teams for this week for everyone to review and we peer assessed each other’s work to see if everyone agreed with it. 
A few changes were made to the entity relationship diagram and the tables created because these changes were required after evaluating the wireframes built from the previous week. 
Also, the group identified what views, stored procedures and triggers were essential to the database. 
This was delegated between four members of the group to complete for next week. 
The other two members were assigned to start developing the admin interface so that it displays the databases.    

Week 8 (7/12/2020-11/12/2020):

In the eighth week, half the group met in person and the other half joined online.  
We reviewed each other’s tasks from last week and discussed issues we came across. 
When looking over the tables we noticed some fields were missing, we determined this was because we forgot to update our normalisation with the new fields we found in previous weeks. 
Two team members were assigned to adjust and test all the trigger, stored procedures, and views with the added columns in the database. 
It took longer than expected to create the basic admin interface, so we extended an extra week and assigned this to a single person this time as there is less to complete than the previous week. 
We then discussed the interim report, we decided that we are now able to start drafting the introduction and background sections of it, we split these between two team members. 
As it is approaching Christmas, we also decided that it was time to start making the basic app interface. 
We assigned this to a single team member to set up the initial app structure and setup a connection to the database.
