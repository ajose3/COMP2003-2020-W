Week 1 (19/10/2020 â€“ 23/10/2020):

In the first week, the group met together and decided what role each member should occupy. 
In this meeting, the group took part in a Belbin team roles test and discussed our previous experiences. 
The results obtained illustrate that the group has a mixture of personalities. 
Additionally, by categorizing Belbin team roles into the three leadership roles, it gave the group a better understanding of the obligations about each member. 
Each of the leadership roles includes one Belbin role that has not been assigned as there are only six of us; therefore, we decided both members in each leadership role will share the unassigned obligations. 
This first meeting has shown what strengths and weaknesses each member of the group holds and how their chosen role will support success to the project.

Week 2 (26/10/2020-30/10/2020):

In the second week, the group met up to decide on our project scenarios and create a project brief. In the meeting we each took turns pitching our project ideas, we had come up with prior, to the rest of the group. Each member came up with at least one project we could do based on the project ideas for each course, provided on the DLE.
We decided to choose the computer science project as a few team members already have a base knowledge of web design and mobile app development which they have studied in their own time. This also worked out well because the majority of the team are studying computer science.
We decided to produce our recommendation system for an online electrical retailer. We plan for it to recommend products to customers based on a combination of their previous purchases and other products they have viewed. 
At the end of this meeting we feel like we have a strong idea of what our project involves and what we need to do next to progress in the module.
